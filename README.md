This is the repo for NeurIPS 2022 paper Learning Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Restless Multi-Action Bandits via Index Awareness

In order to run the code, you will need install gurobi[https://www.gurobi.com/] solver. For larger number of contents and state/action space, you will need either subscribed version or academic license. 

We provide a small synthetic trace example that does not require license. The example contains 3 arms, which all follow birth-death process. The budget is set to 1. The state space is set to {0,1,...,10} and action space is {0,1}. When the action is 0, all arm will
